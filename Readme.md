# Developing Generative AI Applications on AWS v2.x - Lab 2: Develop streaming pattern with Amazon Bedrock APIs 

In this lab, you utilize a Jupyter notebook to explore the capabilities of the Amazon Nova Lite model through the Amazon Bedrock API for text summarization tasks. You investigate both complete and streaming text generation methodologies, learning how to ingest textual content and instruct the model to create meaningful summaries. This lab demonstrates text summarization techniques with small files that fit within the model's context size limitations.

AnyCompany manages extensive volumes of textual content including call transcripts, meeting notes, blog posts, and articles that require efficient summarization for various business purposes. To streamline this process, they aim to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through Amazon Bedrock to automatically generate concise summaries of their content. The company requires a solution capable of handling text input within the model’s context limits while preserving the essential information from the original content.
